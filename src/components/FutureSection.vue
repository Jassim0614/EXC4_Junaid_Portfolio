                    <p>When I imagine my future, I see myself as a college grad and successful person. 
                        I have many aspirations as to what I want to achieve. I have set my aspirations for the future high, 
                        but I know I can accomplish them. If I have made it this far in school, I think I will be able to do 
                        good on the remaining of my education. With hard work and effort, I can achieve anything.</p>
