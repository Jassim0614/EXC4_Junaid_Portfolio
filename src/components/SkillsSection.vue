                    <p>As a computer science student, I possess a strong ability to quickly adapt to new environments and technologies. 
                        My expertise spans various areas: in web development, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        I also have solid programming skills in C++, Java, Python, and C. Additionally, I am knowledgeable in MySQL for database management and have hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub.

                        <p></p>
                </div>I've been gaining experience part-time while studying. As a freelance web developer, I've worked on both front-end and back-end projects, 
                            tackling programming challenges along the way. I've also been part of a team developing an Inventory Management System as a software developer, 
                            which was a great learning experience. Besides coding, I've dabbled in online selling and reselling, exploring my entrepreneurial side. Additionally, 
                            I've worked part-time as a sales representative, learning how to interact with customers and improve sales techniques. These experiences have given me valuable hands-on learning opportunities while I continue to grow and learn in my studies.
